# XnGine-RE

XnGine is a proprietary 3D game engine designed by Bethesda Softworks back in the 90s. 
It was originally designed for usage with The Elder Scrolls 2: Daggerfall, but was used for a handful of other games until Bethesda moved to NetImmerse/Gamebryo for Morrowind (which was originally being worked on in XnGine), and further modified it into the versions of the Creation Engine we have today.

## List of games that use XnGine in chronological release order:

- Terminator: Future Shock (Dec. 1995)
- Terminator: SkyNET (May 1996)
- The Elder Scrolls 2: Daggerfall (Aug. 1996)
- XCar: Experimental Racing (Jul. 1997)
- An Elder Scrolls Legend: Battlespire (Nov. 1997)
- The Elder Scrolls Adventures: Redguard (Oct. 1998)

As stated before, Morrowind was originally being worked on in XnGine until Bethesda deemed the technology too old, and moved to using NetImmerse's engine.

## Misc. details

All versions of the engine were only compiled for MS-DOS w/ Watcom C/C++ and using the DOS4GW DOS extender.
Future Shock, SkyNET and Daggerfall all only used software rendering, but with XCar onward 3DFX Glide support was added in order to allow for hardware accelerated 3D rendering.
I'd need to look into the other few games more exhaustively but Redguard (at least, the 3DFX version) shipped to stores unstripped - so debug symbols have been left intact.
Could be useful for a future decompilation and source port project.
